                                    <p>Dear mates, it has been observed that clients who use their savings to pay for instalment on union meeting day are been approved by the BM as Cash Withdrawal. Be informed that this is a wrong use of Cash Withdrawal
                                        on the BPA platform and should be stopped. Kindly be informed that this is a sanction-able offence. Below is a step by step process to carry out such transaction on the BPA platform. Step 1: The CO should do his/her
                                        weekly instalment collection while omitting the client(s) who intends to pay using their savings Step 2: The CO should save and forward to BM for approval Step 3: BM will approve the weekly collection. This way,
                                        the system will recognize the clients who did no pay When the client(s) are physically present in the office to do a withdrawal and sign the withdrawal ledger, CO can proceed with the following steps. Step 4: CO
                                        initiates a savings withdrawal on the BPA platform, on transaction type, CO will select transfer to Loan Drive Account. Step 5: BM will approve this withdrawal to Loan Drive Account using In & Out functionality.
                                        Step 6: CO will use the loan repayment module to do a default payment for the Client(s) since the amount has been sent to the Client's Loan Drive Account. Step 7: BM will approve the Default payment. Again, Any
                                        deviation from this practice is a sanction-able offence. Let us be guided. Chukwuemeka Louisa (APM)</p>
